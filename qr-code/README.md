Hellooo, mariaigle98 over here.

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 

This is a very basic project for displaying a QR code.

The HTML template was given with the challenge doc, as well as the QR image. On my side is the CSS file.

It's a very simple project, let's see if I can improve it in the future using React and some QR generator packages.

You can find me in Frontend Mentor as well!
